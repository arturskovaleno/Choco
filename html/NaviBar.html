            <p>Chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest signs of use are associated with Olmec sites (within what would become Mexicoâ€™s post-colonial territory) suggesting consumption of chocolate beverages, dating from the 19th century BC.</p>
